Indoor Positioning using Ranging Radios

The purpose of this project will be to develop an Android application to display the users' position in an indoor environment in real time. This will be done using a series of ranging radio nodes positioned on the walls of the test location, to determine a position through trilateration. This will be completed by:
  1)Data collection and proof of concept to determine positions through post processing,
  2)Real time data collection and processing, 
  3)Android application development and testing to display positions in a user friendly interface.
Testing will be completed at each step, including but not limited to various testing environments and data analysis approaches. The possibility of the use of low cost INS to improve the indoor position will also be explored.  

This is the project that will be completed by Group 1 of the ENGO 500 course in the Fall 2018 and Winter 2019 semesters, which is made up of Paul Gratton, Jamie Horrelt, Kate Pexman, and Jeffrey Plett.
